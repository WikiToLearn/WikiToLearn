Are you a student willing to participate in WikiToLearn? Awesome! We have thought of some great ways for you to participate. Here are some guidelines that offer you a perspective of what is possible to help you get started:

Surely you have already got some '''class notes''', though perhaps they are incomplete, poorly organised or not very easy to understand. Why not clean them up a bit and share them on WikiToLearn?

Not only will you learn by re-working your notes, but you will then have a convenient, clear and complete text, which will be much much easier for you to study! By collaborating on WikiToLearn, you will be part of a large project creating free texts, in which many other people contribute to the collection of notes, either by submitting new ones or improving existing ones.

== Step 1: Getting started ==
Let's begin with something that you have already done: do you have particularly well written notes that you would like to share?
* If the related course does not yet exist on WikiToLearn, '''[[Manual/Core concepts: Course|create it]]'''.
* If the course already exists, but the specific topics you want to write about are not present, find out how to '''[[Manual/Core concepts: Section|add new chapters]]'''.
* If you want to create concurrent versions of already existing chapters, first evaluate    whether it would be best just to improve the current version. As a rule of thumb, we try to     avoid duplicating already written material, but if you believe that you have new suggestions, remember that we enthusiastically support field testing.
* If you think that everything already exists, and you don't feel like creating something new, simply print all the material you need and start learning from it! There is no better way to help us improve our material than to study from it and give us your feedback.

If you have already typed your notes in LaTeX, don't worry, our LaTeX to Wiki converter  is just what you need: learn [[Manual/Importing from LaTeX|here]] how to import your text!

If this is the first time you are contributing on WikiToLearn, see the [[Manual|Manual]].

== Step 2: Engage your group ==
A strategy that we often see working well is to find 3 or 4 friends and form a group with them. You should then split the classes between you according to a set calendar, writing and reviewing the notes in turns. With less than a couple hours per week of work, you will gain a beautiful copy of the lessons, even better than a textbook, and you will optimise the time for your study.

== Step 3: Spread the word ==
There is more! Are you a representative or involved in any student organizations? Talk about WikiToLearn with other students! You would be surprised how many of them would love to use or contribute to something like this.

Show them how it works and before you know it a local group within your University will kick off. Introduce the project to your professors as well, they can improve and proofread your notes or, who knows, maybe even participate with their own lecture notes!

With more people involved, everybody gains!
