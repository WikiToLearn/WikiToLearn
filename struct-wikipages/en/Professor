We are very happy you are here. Your knowledge is fundamental to ensure high standards for the content on WikiToLearn - to make it reliable and complete.

== Step 1: Getting started ==
Start from your main area of interest or research. Search on the website if there are some notes already written about it, review and improve them. Keep '''[[WikiToLearn_Manual|this guide]]''' on hand to learn how to apply changes or additions  to  the pages.
On the other hand, if you couldn’t find any existing material suitable to your courses, pick from your notes to '''[[WikiToLearn_Manual/How_to_write_a_topic|create a new course or add new chapters]]'''. in an already existing one.

You can use [[WikiToLearn_Manual|the WikiToLearn manual]] as a really good resource.

In case you have already written something in LaTeX, our LaTeX to Wiki converter is exactly what you need: read '''[[WikiToLearn_Manual/LaTeX_materials_on_wiki|here]]''' how to import your text.

== Step 2: Engage your students ==
The collaboration between you and your students on WikiToLearn has a unique potential both for them and for you, as well as for the project itself: don’t miss out on the opportunity to contribute a large amount of free knowledge to the whole world!

The students will consolidate their knowledge by writing their notes in a more organized way and, thanks to your thorough checking and improving, they will be able to create evolving, exhaustive, proofread and beautifully formatted textbooks.

Reviewing the notes of your students will help you to be aware of their understanding of each lesson, which gives you valuable feedback on the effectiveness of your teaching. You can then customize your classes in order to optimize the educational path.

The resources on WikiToLearn are growing thanks to the contribution of researchers and professors like you, who are collaborating together to make educational material freely accessible, reliable and complete.


== Step 3: Spread the word ==
Do not narrow the project to your class: invite your colleagues and all the institutions you are involved with to collaborate with us to help the project spread. By building such a growing network, both the quantity and the quality of the resources available will continuously improve!
